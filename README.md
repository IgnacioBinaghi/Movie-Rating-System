## Description of Project:
Our project will be a GUI-based Movie Rating application that allows users to search for and
review movies. Users will also be able to create a profile, add notes, manage their watchlists,
see average movie ratings, and track their ratings. Users will be film reviewers/enthusiasts, as
well as System Administrators who control the catalog of movies/users. This application
addresses the problem of needing different applications to perform multiple tasks by providing
one centralized program. It provides users an environment where they can find, record, and
reference movies all in the same place, without the need to use various different search engines
or forms of social media. The data will be persistently stored in a .txt file so that users' data can
be saved to their profile, even after the program terminates.
